/*
Problem: 
Given an even number of people standing in a circle, numbered clockwise from 1, 
each person is looking at the person directly opposite. 
Given numbers a,b,c,find the number being looked at by c, 
if a is looking at b.Output -1 if no such circle exists.

Approach :
1. Let n be the total number of people in the circle.Since opposite person is at n/2 distance
    n=2*|a-b|
2. If a,b,c are greater than n,output -1.
3. The person opposite c is at position c + n/2.If this exceeds n,subtract n. 

Time Complexity: O(1) per test case
Space Complexity: O(1)
