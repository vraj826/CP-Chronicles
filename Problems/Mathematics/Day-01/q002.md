## Problem Description

You are given an integer `n` and an integer `k` (`k ≥ 2`), along with an array of `n` positive integers  
`a1, a2, ..., an`.

Your task is to count the number of unordered index pairs `(i, j)` such that:

- `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n`
- The product `ai × aj` is a **perfect k-th power**

A number is called a perfect k-th power if it can be written in the form `x^k` for some integer `x`.

---

## Input Format

- The first line contains two integers `n` and `k`.
- The second line contains `n` integers `a1, a2, ..., an`.

---

## Output Format

- Print a single integer — the number of valid pairs `(i, j)`.

---

## Constraints

- `2 ≤ n ≤ 100000`
- `2 ≤ k ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ ai ≤ 100000`
