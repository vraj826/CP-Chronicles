# PROBLEM STATEMENT :

There are **n people** standing in a circle. They are numbered from **1 to n** in a clockwise order. The circle is **even** (i.e. *n* is even).

Each person is looking at the person standing exactly opposite him in the circle.

You are given three **distinct** integers **a**, **b**, and **c**. It is known that person **a** is looking at person **b**.

Determine the number of the person that person **c** is looking at.  
If there are **multiple answers**, print **any** of them.  
If there is **no answer**, print **-1**.

---

## Input

The first line contains a single integer **t**  
(**1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴**) — the number of test cases.

Each of the following **t** lines contains three distinct integers **a**, **b**, and **c**  
(**1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10⁸**).

---

## Output

For each test case, print the answer —  
the number of the person that person **c** is looking at,  
or **-1** if the answer does not exist.
